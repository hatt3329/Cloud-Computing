# Lab 4: Guitar Shop SQL Query

# Introduction: 

This lab involved writing and running SQL queries on a guitar shop database provided by the professor. The goal is to demonstrate our ability to query and dissect structured data using basic SELECT statements, filtering, sorting, joining, and performing calculations on relational data.


# Project Design

'products' and 'categories' are used to retrieve product and category details. 'customers' and 'addresses' are used to join/assign addresses. 'order_items' is used to calculate line item totals.


# How to Run

1. Install DBeaver and connect to the local database
2. Run the 'createguitar.sql' file to populate the database
3. Set my_guitar_shop as default and active database
4. open and run any of the query files
5. The results will be displayed in the lower panel
