Hi, this is my first Cloud Computing project. I decided this would be a fun opportunity to make a fun little about me website in the same vein of old geocities sites where people would just make websites filled with their interests and make it feel like their own personal hub. I tried my best to personalize it using HTML's customization tags. One of the parts I was most proud of in this project was the image containers i created on the main page with images you could click on to bring you to the other pages. Each page has my interests correlating to the selected category with a submission box at the bottom to reach out me with your favorite games, movies, and music. I also created a class that serves as a quick navigation between all the pages, located at the top of each page. Each page has their own background images and all 3 of the sub-pages have their own text boxes with custom colors and text. I tried to tread a fine line between classic crude internet pages and also trying to flex some HTML chops.
